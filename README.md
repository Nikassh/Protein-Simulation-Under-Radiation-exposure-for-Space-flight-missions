# ðŸ§¬ Protein Radiation Damage Estimation

This project simulates and estimates **radiation damage on protein structures** using Biopython and real radiation dose data from **NASA GeneLab**.

Perfectly brewed for those looking into **bioinformatics + space research + radiation biology** combos. Inspired by future work in space biosciences at agencies like **NASA** and **ISRO**.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- Parses a **PDB protein structure** (example: `1a2b.pdb`)
- Calculates structural features like:
  - Total sequence length
  - Helix count
  - Sheet count
- Extracts **absorbed radiation doses** from real **GeneLab datasets**
- Converts doses from mSv â†’ Gy
- Simulates **radiation-induced protein damage** using basic modeling

## ðŸ§  Why This Project?

Astronauts and biological specimens face constant exposure to cosmic radiation. This prototype attempts to:
- Understand secondary structure changes due to space radiation
- Lay the foundation for **predictive modeling** of protein damage in space missions
- Connect **space bioinformatics** with **molecular-level insights**
